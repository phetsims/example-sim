### Documentation
The [PhET Development Overview](http://bit.ly/phet-development-overview) is the most complete guide to PhET Simulation Development.
This guide includes how to obtain simulation code and its dependencies, notes about architecture & design, how to test and build
the sims, as well as other important issues.

### Quick Start
(1) Clone the simulation and its dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/example-sim.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/assert.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/axon.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/brand.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/chipper.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/dot.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/joist.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/kite.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/phetcommon.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/scenery.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/sherpa.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/sun.git
```
(2) Start an http-server
(3) Open [http://localhost/example-sim/example-sim_en.html](http://localhost/example-sim/example-sim_en.html) (You will probably need to update this URL based on your HTTP port and relative path.)
(4) Visit the [PhET Development Overview](http://bit.ly/phet-development-overview) for details on minification, testing, architecture, obtaining stable (tested) code, etc.
(5) Contact us at our mailing list: [Developing Interactive Simulations in HTML5](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/developing-interactive-simulations-in-html5)
(6) Help us improve, create a [New Issue](http://github.com/phetsims/example-sim/issues/new)
